# Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list. 
# color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]

color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]

#print( "%s %s"% (color_list[0],color_list[-1]))  # [0] first item of list, [-1] last value
#or
print((color_list[0],color_list[-1]))

# $s :

# It is a string formatting syntax (which it borrows from C).

# Python supports formatting values into strings. Although this can include very complicated expressions, 
# the most basic usage is to insert values into a string with the %s placeholder.

#Here is a really simple example:

# name = input("who are you? ")
# print("hello %s" % (name,))
