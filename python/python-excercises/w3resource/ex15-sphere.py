#Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.

#A sphere is a three-dimensional solid with no face, no edge, no base and no vertex.
# It is a round body with all points on its surface equidistant from the center. The volume of a sphere is measured in cubic units.
#The volume of the sphere is : V = 4/3 × π × r3 = π × d3/6.

pi = 3.1415926535897931
r= 6.0
V= 4.0/3.0*pi* r**3

print('The volume of the sphere is: ',V)
